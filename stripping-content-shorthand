So this {%  %} will keep any white space around it.

And this {%- -%} will strip the white space.

The same applies for {{  }} and {{- -}}.

Or to keep it even more simple {{- -}} is the same as {{ }} but with the strip filter applied to it so it becomes {{ | strip }}.

You can consider it as a shorthand method for stripping the content
